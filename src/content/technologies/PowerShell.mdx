- **Windows PowerShell (1.0 - 5.1):** These versions are preinstalled on Windows and are exclusive to the Windows operating system.
- **PowerShell Core (6.0 - 6.2):** Introduced cross-platform support, running on Windows, macOS, and Linux. This marked a significant shift in making PowerShell a versatile tool beyond just the Windows environment.
- **PowerShell (7.0 and beyond):** With the release of version 7, PowerShell Core was renamed to PowerShell. This version bridges the gap between Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core, providing a consistent experience across all supported platforms.
