- .NET Project Structure Template

## Introduction

Setting up a consistent project structure is crucial for maintainability and collaboration in software development. This template outlines the essential files and their content that should be present in the root of your .NET project. By defining these files, you ensure that every developer has the same configuration and dependencies, leading to a smoother development process.

**Benefits**:

- **Consistency**: Ensures all developers use the same configuration.
- **Simplicity**: Reduces the need for individual setup.
- **Reproducibility**: Makes it easier to onboard new developers and set up CI/CD pipelines.

## Project Structure

In the root of your .NET project, the following files should be present:

```
üìÅ YourProjectRoot
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ YourSolution.sln
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ global.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Directory.Build.props
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nuget.config
```

### Solution File (.sln)

The solution file organizes multiple projects within a single solution. It serves as the entry point for the development environment.

### nuget.config

This file specifies the package sources for NuGet, ensuring that all developers use the same repositories.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <clear />
    <add key="nuget.org" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
    <add key="<custom-repo-name>" value="<custom-repo-url>" />
  </packageSources>
  <packageRestore>
    <add key="automatic" value="True" />
  </packageRestore>
</configuration>
```

- **packageSources**: Defines the NuGet repositories. Clearing the existing ones ensures only the specified sources are used.
	- `<custom-repo-name>`: The name of your custom repository.
	- `<custom-repo-url>`: The URL of your custom repository.
- **packageRestore**: Enables automatic package restore, ensuring that dependencies are restored when the project is built.

### Directory.Build.props

This file contains common properties for all projects within the solution, promoting consistency and reducing duplication.

```xml
<Project>
	<PropertyGroup>
		<Version><project-version></Version>
		<AssemblyVersion><assembly-version></AssemblyVersion>
		<Authors><author-name></Authors>
		<Company><company-name></Company>
		<Product><product-name></Product>
		<Copyright>¬© <current-year> <company-name></Copyright>
		<Description><project-description></Description>
	</PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

- **PropertyGroup**: Contains properties like versioning, authorship, and company information. This ensures that all projects within the solution share the same metadata, simplifying management and reducing errors.
	- `<project-version>`: The version of the project.
	- `<assembly-version>`: The assembly version.
	- `<author-name>`: The name of the author.
	- `<company-name>`: The name of the company.
	- `<product-name>`: The name of the product.
	- `<current-year>`: The current year.
	- `<project-description>`: A description of the project.

### global.json

This file sets the .NET SDK version for the project, ensuring consistency across all development environments.

```json
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "<sdk-version>"
  }
}
```

- **sdk**: Specifies the .NET SDK version to use. This ensures that all developers and build environments use the same version, preventing compatibility issues.
	- `<sdk-version>`: The version of the .NET SDK.
